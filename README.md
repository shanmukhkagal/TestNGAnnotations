# TestNGAnnotations
TestNG Annotations are used to control the next method to be executed in the test script. TestNG annotations are defined before every method in the test code. In case any method is not prefixed with annotations, it will be ignored and not be executed as part of the test code. To define them, methods need to be simply annotated with ‘@Test‘.
